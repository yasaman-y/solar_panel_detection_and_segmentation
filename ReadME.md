# Solar Panel Detection and Segmentation

## Overview
This project aims to detect and segment solar panels on rooftops using object detection and semantic segmentation techniques. The goal is to develop a robust system that can accurately identify solar panels from aerial images, which can be useful for various applications such as solar energy planning, infrastructure monitoring, and environmental analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of aerial images collected from Google Images. The images are annotated with bounding boxes or pixel-wise masks to indicate the locations of solar panels. The dataset is split into training and validation sets to train and assess the performance of the detection and segmentation models.

## Methodology
Object Detection
Object detection is performed using state-of-the-art deep learning models such as Faster R-CNN, YOLO, or SSD. These models are trained on the annotated dataset to learn to detect solar panels in aerial images. The trained models are then used to predict bounding boxes around the detected solar panels in new images.

## Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation is employed to segment the solar panels at the pixel level, providing more detailed information about their spatial extent. Deep neural networks like U-Net, FCN, or DeepLab are trained on the annotated dataset to generate pixel-wise masks for the solar panels in the images.

##Usage
1. Data Preparation: Collect and annotate aerial images containing solar panels. Organize the dataset into training and validation sets.
2. Training: Train the object detection and semantic segmentation models using the annotated dataset. Fine-tune pre-trained models or train from scratch depending on the requirements.
3. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models on the validation set using appropriate metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) for object detection and Intersection over Union (IoU) for semantic segmentation.
4. Inference: Deploy the trained models for inference on new aerial images. Use the object detection model to detect solar panels and the segmentation model to segment them.
5. Analysis: Analyze the results, visualize the detected and segmented solar panels, and assess the accuracy and robustness of the models.

## Results
The performance of the detection and segmentation models is evaluated on the validation set, and the results are presented in terms of precision, recall, mAP, IoU, and qualitative visualizations.

## Future Work
Explore advanced techniques for data augmentation to improve model generalization.
Investigate the use of multi-sensor data fusion for enhanced solar panel detection and characterization.
Extend the application to other types of renewable energy infrastructure detection, such as wind turbines and solar farms.
